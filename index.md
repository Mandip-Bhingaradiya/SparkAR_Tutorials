# Welcome to SparkAR Tutorials

## Software Required: Spark AR Studio (v94)
Spark AR is a studio tool from Facebook that allows us to create our own AR effects for mobile which are direct available on facebooke and instagram.
It is launched in 2017
### Here I have developed some Instagram filters for selfies and also provided filter link which is only open in mobile. 

## Week Days Filter

This is weekDays effect. Here in this effect user is now able to take selfies with week day name with different creative fonts and style. For that user just need to tab on screen to change effect style and take amazing selfy.
